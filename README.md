### 🧠 About Me  
I’m an **Embedded Software Engineer** who enjoys transforming hardware into intelligent digital systems.  
My work spans **bare-metal firmware**, **RTOS-based architectures**, and **connected embedded platforms**, bringing together precise hardware control and scalable software design.

Over the past few years, I’ve contributed to **R&D projects in medical and industrial domains**, designing **low-level drivers**, **hardware abstraction layers**, and **sensor communication frameworks**.  
Most of these solutions are built around **ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers**, focusing on **reliability, modularity**, and **compliance with safety and quality standards** (MISRA C, ISO 13485, IEC 62304).  

💡 *“I believe every circuit has a story — firmware is how it speaks.”*
