## 🧭 About Me
I’m an **Embedded Software Engineer** with 4+ years of experience designing and developing reliable firmware solutions for **ARM Cortex-M**, **PIC**, and **NRF52** microcontrollers.  
I specialize in **C-based driver development**, **RTOS integration (Zephyr, FreeRTOS)**, and **hardware-software co-design**, particularly within **medical, industrial, and IoT domains**.  

My work spans from **bare-metal register-level programming** to **RTOS driver abstraction**, bringing together performance, safety, and compliance with standards like **MISRA C**, **ISO 13485**, and **IEC 62304**.
